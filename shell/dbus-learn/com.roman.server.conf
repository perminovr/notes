POLICY:

Currently, the system bus has a default-deny policy for sending method calls and owning bus names, and a default-allow policy for receiving messages, sending signals, and sending a single success or error reply for each method call that does not have the NO_REPLY flag. Sending more than the expected number of replies is not allowed.
